# CSE-299
This project presents a low-cost, portable IoT-based indoor air quality monitoring system designed to measure environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, and harmful gases (NHâ‚ƒ, NOâ‚“, COâ‚‚, benzene, alcohol, and smoke) in real-time. The system uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller integrated with MQ-135 and DHT11 sensors and communicates with a custom-built Android app via Firebase Realtime Database for live monitoring. Built using MIT App Inventor, the app displays sensor data to help users ensure a healthy indoor environment. The total system cost is under BDT 1500, making it highly affordable compared to commercial alternatives.
